# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to use sql to perform queries to provide management with the number of retiiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.  This is to prepare managemnt for the "silver tsunami" as many  of the current employees are reaching retirement age.

## Results

- One major point that is noticeable from the "retiring_titles" table is that the majority of the seniored positions are being vacated. specifically "senior engineer" and "senior staff"

- They will most likely have plenty of seasoned employees to mentor the newer employees

- The senior engineering positions will most likely take time to refill

- The "silver tsunami" will most likely have an impact that could possibly take some time to recover from


## Summary

72,458 roles will need to be filled between 7 different job titles

It appears that there are enough retirement ready employees that will be able to mentor the next generation of employees.
